# Proposal for Smart Contract Security Audit

## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

- Independent security researcher specializing in smart contract auditing.
- Experienced with Ethereum (Hardhat, Foundry), Solana (Anchor), and tooling (Slither, Mythril).
- Case studies: Automated triage scripts, analysis of ERC20/DeFi protocols, vulnerability research (overflow, reentrancy, access control).

## ðŸ“Œ Scope of Work

- Automated triage (Slither, Mythril, Foundry fuzzing).
- Manual review of contract logic and privilege flows.
- Focus on common vulnerability classes: reentrancy, integer overflows, access control misconfigurations, business logic flaws.

## ðŸ›  Methodology

1. **Static Analysis**: Run automated tools (Slither/Mythril/Foundry).
2. **Manual Review**: Line-by-line contract audit.
3. **Exploitation Testing**: Where applicable, build POCs to demonstrate impact.
4. **Reporting**: Clear categorization by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), with actionable remediation advice.

## ðŸ“Š Deliverables

- Full PDF/Markdown audit report.
- Risk summary table.
- Proof-of-Concepts (if applicable).

## ðŸ’° Pricing & Timeline

- Based on contract size (LoC, complexity).
- Estimated timeframe: 1â€“2 weeks for typical ERC20/DeFi project.
